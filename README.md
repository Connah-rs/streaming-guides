## Introduction
CryptoCompare offers a number of different streaming and polling endpoints for requesting and subscribing to market data. REST requested may be performed via our [polling API](https://min-api.cryptocompare.com/). Streaming via websocket provides an alternative way of consuming our data in a reliable, low latency manner. 

This document serves as a developer guide for integrating with the our market data streamer service.

Please note this service is presently in closed beta and subject to change.
The public interface is presently accessible viaÂ [streaming.cryptocompare.com](streaming.cryptocompare.com) and will require IP whitelisting as well as an API key. This can be requested by contacting us [by email.](mailto:data@cryptocompare.com)

Full implementation details can be found in the [Websocket API reference](WS.md).
